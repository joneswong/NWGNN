# Materials for reproducing the main empirical results

This idea is firstly instantiated with the codebase of GPRGNN, and thus the result on Cora can be reproduced by integrating the corresponding code snippets into the public implementation of GPRGNN.
Other results can be reproduced via integrating the corresponding code snippets into GraphGym.

The logged configurations and execution logs may be helpful for aligning the settings and implementations.
